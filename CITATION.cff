  A productization license specifically designed for open core and owner-first
  use of content (permissible except the latest version) regardless of personal
  use or commercial use. This is a continuous research project's bi-product
  usable for anyone and everyone.

  It is an adoption from the following licenses:

  1. [Open Source Initiative's Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0); AND
  2. [Creative Common Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/); AND
  3. [BSD Licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses).

  To comply with [PlainLanguage.gov](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/), you
  **MUST READ THE LICENSE FILE DIRECTLY**. It must be easily readable for any
  general public audience without assistance.

  If you cannot parse or could not understand any part of the license, that
  means the license has not fully achieve the guideline yet. In that case,
  please file a
  [query issue](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/license-liberal/issues).

  This repository was formerly known as the following but was renamed for
  consistency purposes:

  1. `(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Commercial Open Source License`

  The project was initiated mainly for:

  1. As of year 2024, most legal documents are too specific (e.g. applied to
     software but not images and vice versa) making a lot of product-based
     project inheriting mulitple licenses unnecessarily; AND
  2. Some legal documents' communities are too dramatic for queries; AND
  3. Most legal documents are written in legal-specific languages only lawyer
     can understand rather than written in simple native language comprehensible
     by everyone; AND
  4. A lot of legal documents cannot be iteratively improved with respect to
     time and market conditions; AND
  5. There is a need for a far more liberal license meant for commodity or
     critical products (example: software kernel libraries) that are compatible
     with any other licenses similar to `0BSD` and `CC0` but not public domain.
  6. Most licenses did not cope for generative uses (as in
     "learn-digest-generate") which has Copyright laundering effects (seems like
     Copyright infrigement but the outputs are not).

  This legal document is version controlled using
  [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) defined as follows:

  1. **MAJOR number** - denotes major non-backward compatible changes; AND
  2. **MINOR number** - denotes major backward compatible changes including
     without limited to grammar corrections, fonts, typo, and etc; AND
  3. **PATCH number** - denotes minor backward comaptible changes including
     without limited to updating repository `README.md`, changes of publication
     system, and etc.

  By default, this document is designed to **ALWAYS USE THE LATEST AND
  GREATEST**. For any project repository, you only need to include the notice
  as its legal document into your repository (e.g. as `LICENSE.txt`).

  If your project repository requires only a specific version, **THEN YOU NEED
  TO DOWNLOAD THAT VERSION FULL DOCUMENT AND INCLUDE THE NOTICE** (e.g. as
  `LICENSE.txt`).

  This document is written for comply with:

  1. **[US Plain Language Goverment Guideline](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/)** -
     making legal friendly to any general public without assistances.

  Currently, this document is written for the following languages:

  1. International English (`en`)

  These are the official stewards:

  1. **[(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho](https://chewkeanho.com)** - principal author
     and reviewer.

  These are the folks who indirectly improve this license upto a considerable
  quality either by resources sharing or scanning:

  1. **[Bruce Payne](https://perens.com/)** - for relentlessly providing license
     drafting guidances and emotional positivity.
  2. **Chua, Yee Soong** - for guiding over Malaysia's legal acumen and
     resources.
