A productization license specifically designed for open core and owner-first use
of content (permissible except the latest version) regardless of personal use
or commercial use. This is a continuous research project's bi-product usable for
anyone and everyone.

It is an adoption from the following licenses:

1. [Open Source Initiative's Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0); AND
2. [Creative Common Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/); AND
3. [BSD Licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses).

To comply with [PlainLanguage.gov](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/), you
**MUST READ THE LICENSE FILE DIRECTLY**. It must be easily readable for any
general public audience without assistance.

If you cannot parse or could not understand any part of the license, that means
the license has not fully achieve the guideline yet. In that case, please file a
[query issue](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/license-liberal/issues).

This repository was formerly known as the following but was renamed for
consistency purposes:

1. `(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Commercial Open Source License`




## Why It Is Required

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

The project was initiated mainly for:

1. As of year 2024, most legal documents are too specific (e.g. applied to
   software but not images and vice versa) making a lot of product-based project
   inheriting mulitple licenses unnecessarily; AND
2. Some legal documents' communities are too dramatic for queries; AND
3. Most legal documents are written in legal-specific languages only lawyer can
   understand rather than written in simple native language comprehensible by
   everyone; AND
4. A lot of legal documents cannot be iteratively improved with respect to time
   and market conditions; AND
5. There is a need for a far more liberal license meant for commodity or
   critical products (example: software kernel libraries) that are compatible
   with any other licenses similar to `0BSD` and `CC0` but not public domain.
6. Most licenses did not cope for generative uses (as in
   "learn-digest-generate") which has Copyright laundering effects (seems like
   Copyright infrigement but the outputs are not).




## Version Controlled

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This legal document is version controlled using
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) defined as follows:

1. **MAJOR number** - denotes major non-backward compatible changes; AND
2. **MINOR number** - denotes major backward compatible changes including
   without limited to grammar corrections, fonts, typo, and etc; AND
3. **PATCH number** - denotes minor backward comaptible changes including
   without limited to updating repository `README.md`, changes of publication
   system, and etc.

By default, this document is designed to **ALWAYS USE THE LATEST AND GREATEST**.
For any project repository, you only need to include the notice as its legal
document into your repository (e.g. as `LICENSE.txt`).

If your project repository requires only a specific version, **THEN YOU NEED TO
DOWNLOAD THAT VERSION FULL DOCUMENT AND INCLUDE THE NOTICE** (e.g. as
`LICENSE.txt`).

## Artificial Intelligence (A.I) Decrees

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

This project deploys the use of one or more generative artificial intelligence
such as but not limited to large language model (LLM) for the following tasks:



### Data Sourcing

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing enhanced web searches due to polluted search engine indexes.
> * Performing completely generated media such as but not limited to images,
>   videos, and audios.

* Used for data and reading material searching as the search engine across the
  Internet had collapsed due to A.I publication slops.
* Used for grammar and language correction detection on the human-made written
  script.



### Data Processing & Analytics

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing development via multi-steps queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding* or *agentic AI processing*).
> * Performing data analytics via multi-steps queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding* or *AI vibing*).
> * Performing dedicated and task specific work where conventional technologies
>   could not achieve such as but not limited to upscaling an image verbatim.

No deployment.



### Data Testing

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing end-user use case simulated testings.

No deployment.



### Data Visualization

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing completely generated data visualization via multi-step queries
>   (also known as *vibe coding*).

No deployment.



### Data Archiving & Deletion

> [!Note]
>
> * Performing data clean-up via multi-step queries (also known as
>   *vibe coding*).

No deployment.
